Causal memory for AI agents.
Structured memory objects + causal trace over durable events — so agents can recall why, not just what.

[Quickstart]() · [Features]() · [Supported Clients]() · [Contributing]()

## Core Memory

Give your AI agents persistent memory built for the way conversations actually work. Core Memory is a plug and play, self-hosted conversational memory MCP server that captures each turn as a memory object, builds causal links as the dialogue unfolds, and recalls with full evidence. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, or any MCP-compatible client.

Transcripts are where most decision making actually happens, across agent conversations, email threads, and Slack. Yet every tool treats them as a noisier version of a document. Core Memory is built specifically for that problem.

**Remember every turn:** Each turn produces a memory object linked to prior turns by typed causal edges. Claims are tracked and superseded when contradicted, so memory stays truthful as the dialogue develops.

**Stored as a causal graph:** Memory objects are linked by the relationship between them, like `caused_by`, `contradicts`, and `supports`. When you ask a question, your agent follows the chain of reasoning, not just a ranked vector similarity score. Every result shows you the path of causality between the memory events.

**Depth on demand:** Tune recall(query, effort="low" | "medium" | "high") for your needs. Fast lookup when that is enough, full causal traversal when the question needs it. The orchestrator decides.

**Rolling context injection on a budget:** Compacted memory objects carry only their title, type, and causal associations, allowing 10+ sessions of history to be injected for a fraction of the token cost of naive loading. Promoted objects stay full context when active, and the agent can expand any compacted memory on demand with a single tool call.

## Quick Start

Core Memory auto-detects your embeddings provider from OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, or GOOGLE_API_KEY. No configuration needed.

```bash
uvx "core-memory[mcp]" mcp serve
```

Core Memory starts on http://localhost:8000/mcp and stores data in ~/.core-memory/.

For Claude Code, add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "core-memory": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Start a new conversation. Your agent captures and recalls automatically.

Or install directly from PyPI for Python SDK use:

```bash
pip install "core-memory[mcp]"
```

To ingest existing transcripts, use the CLI command:

`core-memory ingest my-transcript.jsonl`

Or call the ingest tool directly from any connected MCP client. Accepts JSONL or JSON with user/assistant, human/ai, or customer/agent roles.

See the [full setup guide](https://github.com/JohnnyFiv3r/Core-Memory-Demo/blob/claude/update-todo-mnemory-learnings-pLVZ7/docs/integrations/mcp/quickstart.md) for Cursor, ChatGPT, OpenClaw, and adapter configurations for PydanticAI, LangChain, and SpringAI.

## Features

**Transcript-native storage** Built specifically for conversational data, each turn is normalized into a memory object rather than chunked and indexed alongside authored documents.

**Captures every turn automatically** The LLM applies causal labels from a fixed taxonomy rather than judging importance, so nothing is filtered before storage and no explicit "remember this" is required.

**Rolling context injection on a budget** Compacted memory objects carry only their title, type, and causal associations, fitting 10+ sessions of history into a fraction of the token cost of naive loading.

**Causal graph, not a flat index** Memory objects are linked by typed relationships (caused_by, contradicts, supports, and more), so recall follows reasoning chains instead of ranking similarity scores.

**Claims tracked and superseded** Statements like "user prefers PostgreSQL" are monitored and updated when later turns contradict them. Memory stays truthful, not just full.

**Full context is always retrievable** Full transcripts are preserved and linked via turn and session_ID references, so full context is always a tool call away.

**Inspectable retrieval with provenance** Every recall() returns the source conversation, the traversal path that found it, and a verifiable hash. Retrieval is never a black box.

**Depth on demand** recall(query, effort="low" | "medium" | "high") scales from fast lookup to full causal traversal. The orchestrator decides what the question needs.

**Self-hosted MCP** Streamable-HTTP server at /mcp with a canonical agent guide that loads automatically at connection. No system prompt changes needed.

**Auto-detected embedding model** Picks up OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, or GOOGLE_API_KEY from your environment. Runs in degraded mode with one hint if none are set.

**Plug and play adoption** Your data stays on your infrastructure. No cloud dependencies. Works with any MCP client. Native setup guides for Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, and OpenClaw. Any MCP-compatible client works out of the box.

## How It Works

Core Memory separates retrieval from writes, connected through session-scoped storage. Each agent turn follows the same loop:

**Capture:** Call capture() after each turn — or connect via MCP and it happens automatically. Each turn becomes a memory object typed as a decision, lesson, outcome, evidence, or context. An agent judge assigns typed causal associations (caused_by, contradicts, supports, and more), and claims are tracked and superseded when later turns update them. Nothing is filtered before storage — the LLM assigns structure, not importance.

**Recall:** recall(query, effort="low" | "medium" | "high") is the single read verb. Before each agent turn, a bounded context packet is built from the rolling window: promoted memory objects at full context, compacted ones as lightweight stubs. effort="low" runs lexical and semantic anchor search. effort="medium" adds temporal routing. effort="high" runs the full orchestration pipeline: causal traversal, multi-hop chains, goal resolution, and claim-slot enrichment. The orchestrator decides what the question needs.

**Grounding:** Every recall() returns a RecallResult — not just the memory, but the source conversation it came from, the traversal path that found it, and a verifiable hash. The result carries per-memory evidence records and a planning trace showing exactly which retrieval surfaces fired. Retrieval is deterministic from indexed state.

**Maintain:** Memory objects are either promoted (full context in the rolling window) or compacted to title, type, and associations only. Compacted objects remain queryable and their associations stay intact — the agent expands any on demand with a single tool call. Frequently-walked causal edges strengthen over time; rarely-accessed memory compacts naturally.


**Core Concepts**

**Memory Object**
A memory object is a structured unit of recall typed as a decision, lesson, outcome, evidence, context, or another typed event. Each object is either promoted (full context in the rolling window) or compacted (title, type, and associations only). Promoted objects are immediately available; compacted objects can be expanded on demand via a single tool call.

**Rolling Window**
Before each agent turn, Core Memory builds a bounded context packet from the rolling window — the session-scoped set of memory objects visible to the current conversation. Promoted objects contribute full context; compacted stubs contribute their title, type, and associations. The rolling window allows 10+ sessions of history to fit within a standard token budget.

**Associations**
Associations are typed causal or temporal links between memory objects, assigned by an agent judge from a fixed 28-label taxonomy (caused_by, contradicts, supports, and more). Associations remain queryable even as memory objects compact. Unlike semantic similarity links, associations encode the reason one memory relates to another.

**Claims**
Claims are verifiable statements extracted from conversation turns and tracked across sessions. When a later turn contradicts an existing claim, the association graph is updated — the prior claim is superseded, not deleted. The full history of a changing belief is preserved while the current state remains accurate.

**Retrieval Pipeline**
Three canonical surfaces, exposed through recall(query, effort=...):

* `search` — lexical and semantic anchor retrieval (`effort="low"`)
* `trace` — causal traversal from search anchors (`effort="medium"`)
* `execute` — full orchestration: search + trace + goal resolution + claim-slot enrichment (`effort="high"`)

Hydration is explicit post-selection source recovery (turn/tools/adjacent) — not a general retrieval mode and not the same as the rolling window. Retrieval is deterministic from indexed state.

**RecallResult**
Every `recall()` returns a typed `RecallResult` with `evidence[]` (memory objects with grounding hashes), `sources[]`, `steps[]` (which surfaces fired and in what order), `resolved_goals[]`, and `claim_slots{}`. Stable across MCP, REST, and Python SDK.

**Semantic Mode**

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `required` (default) | Fails closed when semantic backend is unavailable |
| `degraded_allowed` | Lexical fallback with degraded markers |

**Storage Backend**

| Backend | Use case |
|---|---|
| `local-faiss` | Development, single-process only (`[semantic]`) |
| `qdrant` | Production, distributed (`[qdrant]`) |
| `pgvector` | Production, Postgres-native (`[pgvector]`) |
| `chromadb` | Development alternative (`[chromadb]`) |

Set via CORE_MEMORY_VECTOR_BACKEND. Avoid local-faiss for multi-worker deployments. See semantic backend docs.

# Drafting checklist (delete before publish)

Before this README ships:

- [ ] Selling lines (hero) all use specific nouns, no hype words
- [ ] One-command install actually works on a fresh box (test it)
- [ ] MCP config snippet is copy-paste-valid (port matches default)
- [ ] Every doc/ link in the documentation table resolves
- [ ] Every client in the supported-clients table has a working setup guide
- [ ] Screenshots reflect actual UI (or section is omitted)
- [ ] Benchmark section: either has real numbers, or is omitted
- [ ] Verb names match what's actually registered (`capture`, `recall`)
- [ ] `RecallResult` JSON example validates against the real schema
- [ ] No mnemory-specific framing leaked through (search for "mnemory", "Qdrant",
      "Cognis", "Hermes" before publish)
- [ ] Tone is declarative + specific, not "powerful" / "intelligent" / "AI-powered"
- [ ] First paragraph passes the "60-second skim" test — does a senior eng know
      what Core Memory does and what makes it different?
- [ ] Causal graph screenshot added to docs/assets/core-memory-causal-graph.png (crop/blur header bar first)
